To build, just run `make` in the current directory
You will need to have installed to build:
- make
- gnu build-essential
- git

If you want to edit code use:
- Windows: CLion
- MacOS: XCode
- Linux: CLion

Before you edit code, you should run install-deps.sh or install-deps.bat based on your os, so that all dependencies download.
