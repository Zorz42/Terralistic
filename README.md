To build, just run:

You will need to have installed to build:
- python3 (to run build.py)
- cmake
- make
- gcc
- zlib

All of those will be installed on MacOS with XCode Developer Tools.

GLFW will be installed by build.py.

If you want to edit code use:

Before you edit code, you should run build.py, so that all dependencies download.
