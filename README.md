To build, just run:
```
python3 build.py
```
You will need to have installed to build:
- python3 (to run build.py, nothing else)
- cmake (on linux and windows)
- make (on linux and windows)
- gcc
- zlib

SFML will be installed by build.py.

If you want to edit code use:
- Windows: CLion
- MacOS: XCode
- Linux: CLion

Before you edit code, you should run build.py, so that all dependencies download.
